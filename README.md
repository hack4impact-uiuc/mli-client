## Overview

This is a React boilerplate that I built in order to learn how to to integrate the different technologies I use in it as well as as a template for [building out](https://github.com/arpanlaha/arpanlaha.com) my [personal website](https://arpanlaha.com), as well as potential other use cases such as with [Hack4Impact UIUC](https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc).

This boilerplate supports Next.js, Redux, and SCSS. I used the following examples and projects for guidance:

- [Next.js's Redux example](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-redux)
- [Hack4Impact Recruitment Portal](https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/h4i-recruitment)
- [react-async](https://github.com/ghengeveld/react-async) (inspiration for [LoadWrapper](/components/LoadWrapper.jsx))

See the [wiki](https://github.com/arpanlaha/react-boilerplate/wiki) for more details about specific parts of the boilerplate.
